# Matrix
Hi y'all! This Java project is just a fun try at coding some matrix operations with two or less matrixes, including addition, multiplication, scalation, and transposition. Once I get finished with those, I'll try to see if I can do inverses by hand, but it may prove to be too difficult to do in any kind of reasonable time. If you see anything wrong or something inefficient, let me know! I'm trying to do this without simply importing libraries to do all the work for me, so any help would be appreciated!
